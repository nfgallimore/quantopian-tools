## Documentation

Check out our documentation on [readthedocs](http://quantopian-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


## Development

### Makefile Targets

> Makefile commands will only work inside a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) or a
[condaenv](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html)

#### `make init`

Initializes the virtualenv with an up-to-date version of setuptools, pip, and
[pip-tools](https://github.com/nvie/pip-tools/).

#### `make install`

Runs [pip-compile] with `requirements/py<current interpreter version>.txt` and produces a compiled requirement file in
the `.cache` directory . The [pip-sync] is ran with the newly compiled requirements file. This makes sure you are
running with the latest release of dependencies, assuming you haven't pinned them in the
`requirements/py<current interpreter version>.txt` file.

#### `make lint`

Runs [pylint] and [pep8] on all packages in the project directory.

#### `make test`

Runs [py.test] tests located inside the tests/ folder and any test files nested in a package in the project directory.
Coverage is only calculated in this target.

#### `make test-unit`

Same as `make test` excluding coverage and tests marked as `integration`.

#### `make test-integration`

Same as `make test` excluding coverage and tests **not** marked as `integration`.

#### `make build`

Builds a wheel using setuptools' bdist_wheel command. Locally builds are tagged with dev (ex 0.1.0+dev). In the travis
build environment the wheel is tagged with the job number (ex. 0.1.0+build1.1).

#### `make clean`

Cleans the project of compiled python files and files generated by the above commands such as build and dist directories.
